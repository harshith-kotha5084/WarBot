# WarBot

This is human detection bot which uses a raspberry pi module to detect human in the frame using the Open CV framework for python
It uses the Adafruit stepper motor hat library to control the stepper motors and control the movements to adjust it to the frame
It uses the relay module to shoot at the target using laser module
It has a wireless connection, using the IP Address of the Raspberry PI.

We have also tried extending it to the movement where it follows a lane.
and stops as soon as it detects a human and shoot at it.
